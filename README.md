D-Screen AI's Mission:

Our mission is to provide adolescents and young adults with resources that assess social media addiction and provide personalized reminders and advice.


Why D-Screen AI?

As social media usage is becoming a growing problem in this digital age, we must be aware of our screen time habits and usage as long-term use can negatively affect brain development. Excessive social media usage can lead to physical health problems, mental health issues, and decreased academic performance. D-Screen AI allows adolescents and young adults to monitor their screen usage by offering personalized advice through Generative AI.
